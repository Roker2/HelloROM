With the re-brand of CM to LineageOS (LOS) became LineageOS based with some tweaks from AOSP, and we are now based on GZOSP for Pie. If there are any bugs, either we will sort them out or the GZOSP team will if it concerns their code base. This rom isn't GZOSP supported, so no need to report errors/bugs to them!",
